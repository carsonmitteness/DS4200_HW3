    <p> Hello! My name is Carson Mitteness, and one of my interests outside
         of my major is the oceans and the animals that reside in them. I 
         have always had an interest the wildlife of our planet since I 
         was a kid and this developed into an interest on sustainability.
          This led me to co-op at a company that focuses on researching 
          the sustainability of companies' energy resources and give them 
          the data they would need to improve their energy consumption. I 
          choose to focus on the oceans because I have taken a lot of 
          classes relating to this issue such as oceanography and a class
           about Earthâ€™s Oceans when I studied abroad in Spain. This 
           class in Spain really opened my eyes to how different animals 
           can be wiped out of existence due to human activity. For 
           example, one lagoon we went to used to be populated with a ton
            of seahorses; however, today there is no seahorses left in 
            the lagoon. This is due to human development on the shores of 
            the lagoon leading to pollutants getting dumped into the 
            lagoon. Local agricultural practices also led to fertilizer 
            being put in the water which in turn lead to the seahorse 
            population rapidly declining.
