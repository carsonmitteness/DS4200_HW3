    <p> There are many endangered marine species outside the seahorses in 
        Spain. The most endangered marine species in the world is the Vaquita.
         The main cause of the endangerment of Vanquitas is overfishing. They 
         often die from being entangled in fishing nets. The fishermen do not 
         even intend to capture the Vanquita; however, they often cast wide 
         nets to catch a ton of fish at once. This type of fishing is dangerous 
         as it can lead to endangered species also getting caught in the net. 
         The reason that this is so dangerous to the Vanquita is that they 
         have a small range of swimming, and the range that they inhabit is 
         home to many valuable fish. They share the waters with the totoaba 
         fish, which is extremely valued because the swim bladders fetch a high 
         price in the black market as well as its medicinal properties in 
         Chinese medicine. This is a common theme among endangered marine 
         animals, and poor fishing practices lead to severe population decline 
         across multiple species. It is important for these governments to shut 
         down these illegal practices as soon as they start so we can look out 
         for our ocean’s health. These animals keep these ecosystems’ 
         populations in check and provide a balanced ocean living environment.
